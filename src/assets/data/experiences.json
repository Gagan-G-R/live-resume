The college undertakes periodic counseling for all students to identify what really drives the students and encourages them. Potential performers are identified based on the weekly test analysis and they are rigorously trained to give them a competitive edge.  Advice and support is also provided to help them to improve their scores. We have noted that this has resulted in healthy competition among students across all Deeksha campuses. Teachers are available for doubt clarifications and counseling even after college hours. Students are encouraged to approach the teachers at any time. In addition to the weekly tests, students are also given mock tests to practice before the exams to improve their confidence.",

Together the two concepts are helping businesses and governments to focus their resources on the core functions. Cloud computing brings big data within the reach of enterprises, big and small. They can now work with unstructured data at a huge scale. The competitive edge of the future will lie in extracting the business value from a sea of data made possible by the cloud. As the cloud and the data it holds turn critical with multiple ramifications, it requires a cautious approach to handling the cloud computing and big data.",
